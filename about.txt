The system is working correctly. The model processed your ECG file and returned a prediction.
What this means
"Abnormal (Possible arrhythmia detected)" indicates:
The ensemble probability exceeded 0.5 (threshold)
The model detected features consistent with abnormal ECG patterns
Understanding the prediction
The model uses:
CNN + BiLSTM deep learning model (60% weight)
XGBoost model (40% weight)
Threshold: 0.5
Note
This is a predictive tool and not a medical diagnosis. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical decisions.
Next steps
Upload different ECG files to see how predictions vary
Compare predictions across different files
The system handles both .dat (MIT-BIH) and .csv formats
If you want to see the exact probability score or make adjustments, let me know.
